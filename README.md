# Tesla Stock Exploratory Analysis

Dataset downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/tesla-stock-price-history.

This dataset, originally sourced from Yahoo Finance, provides a history of Tesla stock prices from 2010 to 2025, with information on daily opening and closing prices, highest and lowest prices, and total trading volume.  

I used the dataset to perform some exploratory data analysis and visualize trends on ![Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ijuzu/vizzes):
